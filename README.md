The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic, available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, is a dataset used for cancer diagnosis research. It contains features derived from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) biopsies of breast masses. These features, which describe characteristics of cell nuclei, are useful for developing machine learning models to differentiate between malignant and benign tumors. The dataset includes 569 instances and 32 attributes, making it an ideal resource for developing and evaluating diagnostic algorithms for breast cancer.
